# Interview Prep

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** preparation repository for interviews! This repo contains a collection of problems that I am solving from various sources, including **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, and more. 

The goal is to strengthen my problem-solving skills and become well-prepared for upcoming technical interviews. Each folder or section will be dedicated to specific topics, and I'll be consistently adding more problems as I work through them.

---

### Topics Covered:
- **Arrays**
- **Strings**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks and Queues**
- **Trees**(trees/visible node.py)
- **Graphs**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Sorting and Searching**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Backtracking**
- **Bit Manipulation**

### Progress (I have not added the problems i have already solved will do it later)

| **Topic**                | **Problems Solved** | **Difficulty**     | **Completion** |
